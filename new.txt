This study unit is the 
first of two
 that presents items that are included in gross income, income
items that are excluded from gross income, and income items for which the Internal Revenue Code
provides a partial exclusion from gross income. The 
following
 formula is an overview of the steps to
compute federal income tax liability for individual taxpayers.

.
2.1   GROSS INCOME
The IRC (Internal Revenue Code) defines gross income as all income from whatever source
derived except as otherwise provided.
1.
Section 61(a) enumerates types of income that constitute gross income. The list is not exhaustive.
a.
Compensation for services, including fees, commissions, and fringe benefits
b.
Gross income derived from business
c.
Gains derived from dealings in property
d.
Interest
e.
Rents
f.
Royalties
g.
Dividends
h.
Annuities
i.
Income from life insurance and endowment contracts (This is a broader application than
the general exclusion for proceeds due to death.)
j.
Pensions
k.
Income from discharge of indebtedness
l.
Distributive share of partnership gross income
m.
Income in respect of a decedent (income earned but not received before death)
n.
Income from an interest in an estate or trust
A 2017 tax law change removed alimony and separate maintenance payments from the
above
 list as divorces executed after 2018 no longer include these items in gross income.
However, payments under a divorce executed before 2019 are still included in gross
income and may be tested as such on the exam.
2.
Other types of income also constitute gross income unless a statute specifically excludes them.
a.
This specifically includes income derived from all sources regardless of whether the
taxpayer receives a Form W-2 or Form 1099.
b.
Form 1099-MISC is used for reporting a variety of types of income not reported on a
W-2 or other specific Form 1099s. Any errors on this form should be reported to the
payor. If the payor will not correct and reissue the new form, the taxpayer must attach an
explanation and report the correct amount.

Domestic vs. Foreign Source Income
3.
There are several factors that determine the source (domestic or foreign) of a specific type of
income. The 
following
 table explains the general rules:
Item of Income
Factor Determining Source
Salaries, wages, other compensation
Where services performed
Business income:
Personal services
Sale of inventoryŠpurchased
Sale of inventoryŠproduced
 
Where services performed
Where sold
Allocation
Interest
Residence of payor
Dividends
Whether a U.S. or foreign corporation
Rents
Location of property
Royalties:
Natural resources
Patents, copyrights, etc.
 
Location of property
Where property is used
Sale of real property
Location of property
Sale of personal property
Seller™s tax home
Pension distributions attributable to
contributions
When services were performed that
earned the pension
Investment earnings on pension contributions
Location of pension trust
Sale of natural resources
Allocation based on fair market value
of product at export terminal
4.
Items are included in income based on the method of accounting used by the taxpayer.
a.
The cash method of accounting includes income when constructively received.
b.
The accrual method of accounting reports income when
1)
All events have occurred fixing the right to receive the income.
2)
The amount can be determined with reasonable accuracy.
c.
The accrual method of accounting is required when there are inventories.
d.
The hybrid method allows a business to use the cash method for the portion of the
business that is not required to be on the accrual method.
e.
Income is reported when it can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. Adjustments are
made in a later year for any differences between the actual amount and the previously
reported amounts.
  E
XAMPLE
 
2-1              Cash vs. Accrual-Method Income
Lucy is a calendar-year accrual-method taxpayer. She provided services on December 21, Year 1. She billed
the customer in the first week of January Year 2 but did not receive payment until February Year 2. She must
include the amount received for the services in her Year 1 income. If she were on the cash basis, she would
report the income in Year 2.

.
Constructive Receipt
5.
Income, although not actually in a taxpayer™s possession, is constructively received in the taxable
year during which it is credited to his or her account, set apart for him or her, or otherwise made
available so that (s)he may draw upon it at any time, or so that (s)he could have drawn upon it
during the taxable year if notice of intention to withdraw had been given.
a.
A check received in the mail is considered to be income on the date received, whether or
not it is cashed.
b.
To determine receipt of income from securities trades, the trade date, rather than the
settlement date, should be used.
c.
However, income is not constructively received if the taxpayer™s control of its receipt is
subject to substantial limitations or restrictions.
d.
Constructive receipt applies to the cash method of accounting. Under the accrual method,
income is reported in the year earned.
Claim-of-Right Doctrine
6.
A taxpayer receiving payments under a claim of right and without restrictions on its use or
disposition includes the payment in income in the year received even though the right to retain
the payment is not yet fixed or the taxpayer may later be required to return it.
a.
If payment is not received, then the payment is not included in income.
Compensation for Services
7.
All compensation for personal services is gross income. The form of payment is irrelevant.
a.
If services are paid for in property, its fair market value at the time of receipt is gross
income.
b.
The amount included in income becomes the basis in the property.
c.
If services were performed for a price agreed on beforehand, the price will be accepted as
the FMV of the property only if there is no evidence to the contrary.
d.
Gross income of an employee includes any amount paid by an employer for a liability
(including taxes) or expense of the employee.
e.
Income from self-employment is included in gross income. The director of a corporation is
considered self-employed, and all fees are included in gross income.
f.
Reported and unreported compensation (e.g., tips) is gross income.
1)
Food service employers required to allocate tip income use 8% of food and drink
sales to determine the allocable amount.

Business Income from Electronic Payments
8.
Taxpayers who receive payments in either of the 
following
 forms will receive a Form 1099-K,
Payments Card and Third Party Network Transactions
, from the payment settlement entity:
a.
From payment cards (e.g., credit/debit/stored-valued cards), or
b.
Through a third-party network when the total transactions exceed both $20,000 in value
and 200 in volume for the year.

Virtual Currency
9.
In some environments, virtual currency, e.g., Bitcoin, operates like ﬁrealﬂ currency (i.e., the coin
and paper money of the United States or of any other country that is designated as legal tender,
circulates, and is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of
issuance), but it does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction.
a.
Virtual currency is treated as property for U.S. federal tax purposes. General tax principles
that apply to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency. Among
other things, this means that
1)
Wages paid to employees using virtual currency are taxable to the employee, must
be reported by an employer on a Form W-2, and are subject to federal income tax
withholding and payroll taxes.
2)
Payments using virtual currency made to independent contractors and other service
providers are taxable and self-employment tax rules generally apply. Normally,
payors must issue Form 1099.
3)
The character of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of virtual currency depends
on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.
4)
A payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the
same extent as any other payment made in property.
b.
A taxpayer who receives virtual currency as payment for goods or services must, in
computing gross income, include the fair market value of the virtual currency, measured
in U.S. dollars, as of the date the virtual currency was received.
Prepaid Income
10.
Generally, prepaid income is taxable in the year received whether the taxpayer is on the cash or
accrual method of accounting.
a.
Prepayments for merchandise inventory are not income until the merchandise is shipped.
Bartering
11.
Bartered services or goods are included in gross income at the fair market value of the item(s)
received in exchange for the services.

Assignment of Income
12.
Gross income includes income attributable to a person even though the income is received by
other persons. This doctrine imposes the tax on income on those who earn it, produce the right
to receive it, enjoy the benefit of it when paid, or control property that is its source.
  E
XAMPLE
 
2-2              Assignment of Income
Swift, a life insurance salesperson, directs his employer to pay his commissions to his daughter. The
commissions paid to Swift™s daughter are gross income to Swift.
a.
The doctrine applies to income earned by personal services or derived from property.
  E
XAMPLE
 
2-3              Assignment of Income Derived from Property
Taxpayer makes a gift of interest earned on securities to her 20-year-old daughter who attends college. The
interest is gross income to Taxpayer.
b.
Assignment of an income-producing asset is effective to shift the gross income to the
assignee.
  E
XAMPLE
 
2-4              Assignment of Income-Producing Asset
Taxpayer gives the underlying securities to her 20-year-old daughter. Interest earned after the transfer is
gross income to the daughter.
c.
Effective assignment requires that the transfer of property be complete and bona fide,
with no control retained over either the property or the income it produces, and that the
transfer take place before the income is actually earned.
Royalties
13.
Royalties are payments to an owner from people who use a right belonging to that owner.
Royalties constitute ordinary gross income and are not a return of capital.
Personal Rental Income
14.
Cash or the FMV of property or services received for the use of personal property is taxable as
rental income.
a.
Schedule C (not Schedule E, which is for rental of real estate) is used if the taxpayer is
in the business of renting personal property. A taxpayer is in the business of renting
personal property if the primary purpose for renting the property is income or profit
and the taxpayer is involved in the rental activity with continuity and regularity. If rental
of personal property is not a business, any income and deductions from the rental of
personal property for profit must be reported on Form 1040 (Schedule 1).
Not-for-Profit Rental Income
15.
If property is not rented to make a profit, under hobby loss rules, taxpayers cannot deduct their
expenses.
a.
Not-for-profit rental income is reported on Form 1040 or 1040-NR. Taxpayers can
include their casualty losses on the appropriate lines of Schedule A if they itemize their
deductions.
b.
If rental income is more than rental expenses for at least 3 years out of a period of
5 consecutive years, taxpayers are presumed to be renting property to make a profit.

.
c.
If taxpayers are starting a rental activity and do not have 3 years showing a profit, they can
elect to have the presumption made after they have the 5 years of experience required by
the test. They may choose to postpone the decision of whether the rental is for profit by
filing Form 5213.
1)
Form 5213 must be filed within 3 years after the due date of the return (determined
without extensions) for the year in which the taxpayer first carried on the activity
or, if earlier, within 60 days after receiving written notice from the Internal Revenue
Service proposing to disallow deductions attributable to the activity.
Alimony
16.
Alimony and separate maintenance payments are included in the gross income of the recipient
(payee) and are deducted from the gross income of the payor for divorce decrees executed
(i.e., established) prior to 2019. Alimony is not deductible by the payor and is not included in the
gross income of the recipient if (a) the divorce is finalized after 2018 or (b) a pre-2019 divorce is
modified after 2018 and that modification expressly provides for exclusion from income.
a.
A payment is considered to be alimony (even if paid to a third party, e.g., home mortgage)
when it is
1)
Paid in cash
2)
Paid pursuant to a written divorce or separation instrument
3)
Not designated as other than alimony
4)
Terminated at death of recipient
5)
Not paid to a member of the same household
6)
Not paid to a spouse with whom the taxpayer is filing a joint return
Child Support
b.
Child support payments are an exclusion from the gross income of the recipient and are
not deductible by the payor. These payments are not alimony.
1)
If the divorce or separation instrument specifies payments of both alimony and
child support, and only partial payments are made, then the partial payments are
considered to be child support until this obligation is fully paid, and any excess is
then treated as alimony.
2)
If the payment amount is to be reduced based on a contingency relating to a child
(e.g., attaining a certain age, marrying), the amount of the reduction will be treated
as child support.
Property Settlement
c.
Property settlements, which are simply a division of property, are not treated as alimony.
1)
Property transferred to a spouse or former spouse incident to a divorce is treated as
a transfer by gift, which is specifically excluded from gross income.
a)
ﬁIncident to a divorceﬂ means a transfer of property within 1 year after the date
the marriage ceases or a transfer of property related to the cessation of the
marriage.
b)
This exclusion does not apply if the spouse or former spouse is a nonresident
alien.

.
Annuity Contracts
17.
The portion of amounts received under an annuity contract for which a statute does not provide
an exclusion is gross income. Taxpayers are permitted to recover the cost of the annuity (the
price paid) tax-free.
  E
XAMPLE
 
2-5              Annuity Contracts
Donna paid $1,200 for an annuity that pays $200 per month for an entire year, for a total of $2,400 ($200 ×
12 months). The percentage of each payment that can be excluded is 50% ($1,200 price of annuity ÷ $2,400
total payments). Therefore, Donna may exclude $100 ($200 × 50%) of each payment from income for a total
of $1,200 ($100 × 12 months).
401(k) Plans
18.
Employer contributions generally are not included in the income of the participant.
Income from Life Insurance and Endowment Contracts
19.
Proceeds received due to the death of the insured are generally excluded from gross income.
a.
Interest paid on the proceeds of a policy that is paid out over time is gross income to the
beneficiary.
b.
The amount excluded from gross income of an applicable policy holder with respect to
an employer-owned life insurance contract is not to exceed the premiums and other
amounts paid by the policyholder for the life insurance policy.
1)
The income inclusion rule does not apply to a member of the insured™s family, to
any individual who is the designated beneficiary of the insured under the contract
(other than an applicable policy holder), to a trust established for the benefit of the
insured™s family or a designated beneficiary, or to the estate of the insured.
c.
If the
 owner of a policy transfers the policy to another person for consideration, the
proceeds are taxable. However, amounts paid to acquire the policy and subsequent
premium payments are treated as return of investment capital.
Debt Discharge
20.
Discharge of indebtedness can result in gross income.
a.
Gross income includes the cancellation of indebtedness when a debt is canceled in whole
or in part for consideration.
1)
If a creditor cancels a debt (Form 1099-C) in consideration for services performed
by the debtor, the debtor must recognize income in the amount of the debt as
compensation for his or her services.
2)
Income from discharge of indebtedness is reported on the same form as for any
other income (i.e., Schedule C for a sole proprietor).
b.
Generally, a corporation has gross income from discharge of indebtedness when it
satisfies a debt by transferring its own corporate stock to the creditor.
1)
The amount of gross income is the amount by which the principal of the debt exceeds
the value of the transferred stock, plus the value of any other property transferred.
c.
If a creditor gratuitously cancels a debt, the amount forgiven is treated as a gift (the IRC
generally provides for exclusion of gifts from gross income).
d.
Exceptions. Gross income does not include discharges that
1)
Occur in bankruptcy, except the stock for debt transfer as described in 
item 20.b.
above
.

.
2)
Occur when the debtor is insolvent but not in bankruptcy.
a)
The amount excluded is the smaller of the debt canceled or the amount of
insolvency, based on the excess of liabilities over the FMV of assets on the
date of debt cancellation.
3)
Are related to qualified farm indebtedness.
4)
Are a discharge of qualified real property business indebtedness.
5)
Are related to principal residence indebtedness. (
Item i. below
 has more information
on this exception.)
e.
When a taxpayer excludes discharge of indebtedness under 
d.1), 2), or 3) on the previous
page and above
, the taxpayer must reduce his or her tax attributes in the 
following
 order:
1)
NOLs and NOL carryovers
2)
General business credit
3)
Minimum tax credit
4)
Capital loss carryovers
5)
Basis of the taxpayer™s property
6)
Passive activity loss and passive activity credit carryovers
7)
Foreign tax credit carryovers
NOTE: The taxpayer may first elect to decrease the basis of depreciable property.
f.
When there is a debt discharge involving real property, there are typically 
two
 separate
transactions:
1)
The property is sold to the lender when the property is acquired by the lender for the
debt. Form 1099-A may be issued. A gain or loss may be required to be reported
on the transaction.
2)
The lender cancels the debt. Form 1099-C may be issued. Income may have to be
reported as discussed 
above
.
g.
The sale of the property and the cancellation of the debt do not have to occur in the same
year. If they occur in the same year, the lender will issue only a Form 1099-C.
h.
When a canceled debt is a nonbusiness debt (e.g., discount for early payment of a
mortgage loan), it is to be reported as cancellation of debt under Other Income on
Form 1040 (Schedule 1).
  E
XAMPLE
 
2-6              Debt Cancellation
The amount of debt cancellation as a reward for early payoff of a home mortgage is cancellation of debt
reported as Other Income on Schedule 1, Form 1040.
i.
The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act excludes discharges of up to $750,000
($375,000 if married filing separately) of indebtedness, which is secured by a principal
residence and which is incurred in the acquisition, construction, or substantial
improvement of the principal residence.
1)
This exclusion applies to discharge of debt occurring after December 31, 2020, and
before January 1, 2026.
2)
The amount excluded from gross income reduces the basis of the residence, but not
below zero, and only when the taxpayer retains the residence.
3)
Principal residence has the same meaning as when used in Sec. 121.
4)
The exclusion does not apply if the discharge is due to any reason not directly
related to a decline in the home™s value or the taxpayer™s financial condition.

.
Student Loan Cancellation
j.
Federal, state, and/or local government student loan indebtedness may be discharged and
excluded from income until 2026 unless the loan is a private education loan or made by
a tax-exempt organization. If the debt is discharged and the former student engages in
certain employment (e.g., in a specified location, for a specified period, for a specified
employer), the discharge is actually compensation for work provided directly to a lender.
Discharge due to the death or total and permanent disability of the student may also be
excluded from income.
Social Security Benefits
21.
Social Security benefits are generally not taxable unless additional income is received. The gross
income inclusion is dependent upon the relation of provisional income (PI) to the base amount
(BA) and the adjusted base amount (ABA).
a.
PI = Adjusted gross income (AGI) + Tax-exempt interest + Excluded foreign income +
Several other exclusions and deductions + 50% of Social Security benefits.
b.
BA means $32,000 if married filing jointly (MFJ), $0 if married filing separately and having
lived with the spouse at any time during the tax year (MFSLT), or $25,000 for all others.
c.
ABA is the BA plus $12,000 if MFJ, $0 if MFSLT, or $9,000 for all others.

2-7              Taxable Social Security Benefits
Mr. and Mrs. Slom, both over 65 and filing jointly, received $20,000 in Social Security benefits. Additionally,
they reported $30,000 of taxable interest, $15,000 of tax-exempt interest, $18,000 in dividends, and a taxable
pension of $16,000. Therefore, their AGI excluding Social Security benefits is $64,000 ($30,000 taxable interest
+ $18,000 dividends + $16,000 taxable pension payments).
l
PI is $89,000 [$64,000 AGI + $15,000 tax-exempt interest + 50% of Social Security benefits
($10,000)].
l
The adjusted base amount is $44,000.
l
Gross income will include $17,000 (85% of Social Security benefits) since this amount is less than
85% of the excess of PI over the ABA plus the lesser of 50% of the incremental BA ($6,000) or 50%
of Social Security benefits.

Railroad Retirement
22.
The Railroad Retirement Board allows for participants to receive retirement annuities at age 60
with 30 or more years of service. Social Security beneficiaries are not eligible until age 62,
regardless of how long they have been paying into the system.
a.
The Social Security Benefits Worksheet is used to determine whether any of the benefits
are taxable.
Illegal Activities
23.
Income from illegal activities is gross income.
Scholarships
24.
Amounts received by an individual as scholarships or fellowships are excluded from gross
income to the extent that the individual is a candidate for a degree from a qualified educational
institution and the amounts are used for required tuition or fees, books, supplies, or equipment
(not personal expenses, such as room and board).
a.
Gross income includes any amount received, e.g., as tuition reduction, in exchange for the
performance of services, such as teaching or research.
b.
Generally, a reduction in undergraduate tuition for an employee of a qualified educational
organization does not constitute gross income.
c.
Subsistence payments administered by Veteran Affairs are excluded from gross income.
  E
XAMPLE
 
2-8              Scholarships
Laura received a scholarship of $2,500, and as a condition for receiving the scholarship, Laura must serve as
a part-time teaching assistant. Of the $2,500 scholarship, $1,000 represents payment for teaching. Assuming
Laura only uses her scholarship for qualified education expenses, Laura will be able to exclude $1,500 from
income. The $1,000 she received for teaching is taxable and must be included in income.

Prizes and Awards
25.
If the prize or award is in a form other than money, the amount of gross income is the FMV of the
property. The honoree may avoid inclusion by rejecting the prize or award. Some prizes and
awards are excludable.
a.
An award recipient may exclude the FMV of the prize or award from his or her gross
income if
1)
The amount received is in recognition of religious, scientific, charitable, or similar
meritorious achievement;
2)
The recipient is selected without action on his or her part;
3)
The receipt of the award is not conditioned on substantial future services; and
4)
The amount is paid by the organization making the award to a tax-exempt
organization (including a governmental unit) designated by the recipient.
b.
A prize or award may qualify for exclusion as a scholarship.
c.
Certain employee achievement awards may qualify for exclusion from the employee™s
gross income as a de minimis fringe benefit.
1)
Employee achievement awards may qualify for exclusion from the recipient
employee™s gross income if they are awarded as part of a meaningful presentation
for safety achievement or length of service and
a)
The awards do not exceed $400 (cost to employer) for all nonqualified plan
awards,
b)
The awards do not exceed $1,600 (cost to employer) for all qualified plan
awards, and
c)
The awards are tangible personal property. Cash and cash equivalents,
including gift cards, are not tangible personal property.
2)
Awards in excess of limitations
a)

Community Property Income
50.
The question of tax liability for married persons filing separate returns arises frequently during
discussions concerning to whom income is taxable. Several states have community property
laws. These states require significantly different treatment of tax liability than in states without
such laws.
a.
In the 
nine
 community property states of Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada,
New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin, all property acquired by spouses 
after
marriage is considered as owned by them in community, and as such, is referred to as
community property.
1)
Any income from these properties is automatically considered joint or community
income, and if taxpayers are filing separate tax returns, the income would be
shared equally between them on their separate returns.
2)
Wisconsin has implemented a marital property act; therefore, for federal income tax
purposes, it is considered a community property state.
3)
Alaska adopted an optional system whereby a couple can choose to opt in to the
community property system.
b.
Property acquired 
before
 marriage or inherited by one spouse during marriage is
considered to be that spouse™s separate property.
1)
In California, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Washington, any income from
these separate properties is considered separate income; thus, if the spouses are
filing separately, the income would not be shared and would be reported on that
spouse™s separate return.
2)
Conversely, in Texas, Idaho, Louisiana, and Wisconsin, income from these
separate properties is considered community income; thus, if the spouses are filing
separately, the income would be shared between them on their separate returns.
c.
Section 66 of the IRC sets forth a specific rule for treatment of community income when
the spouses live apart. The need for this section arose because, in community property
states, each spouse is liable for one-half of the tax on income. Generally, when spouses
are living apart, the spouse that earns the income will keep it.
d.
If two individuals are married to each other at some time during a calendar year but live
apart for the 
entire
 tax year, do not file a joint return, and one or both have earned
income, none of which is transferred between them, the 
following
 rules cover the
reporting of income on their separate tax returns:
1)
Earned income (other than trade or business income and partnership income) is
treated as income of the spouse who rendered the personal services.
2)
Trade or business income shall be treated as the gross income and deductions of
the spouse carrying on such trade or business or, if such trade or business is jointly
operated, treated as the gross income and deductions of each spouse on the basis
of their respective distributive share of the gross income and deductions.
3)
Community income derived from the separate property of one spouse is treated as
the income of such spouse.
4)
All other community income is taxed in accordance with the applicable community
property law.

works primarily or wholly for a specific company.
b.
If workers are independent contractors under the common law rules, such workers may
nevertheless be treated as employees by statute (statutory employees) for certain
employment tax purposes if they fall within any one of the 
following four
 categories and
meet the 
three
 conditions described under Social Security and Medicare taxes (listed in
item d. below
):
1)
A driver who distributes beverages (other than milk) or meat, vegetable, fruit, or
bakery products, or who picks up and delivers laundry or dry cleaning, if the driver
is the business agent or is paid on commission.
2)

insurance or annuity contracts, or both, primarily for one life insurance company.
3)

names if the taxpayer also furnishes specifications for the work to be done.
4)
A full-time traveling or city salesperson who works on the taxpayer™s/employer™s
behalf and turns in orders to the taxpayer from wholesalers; retailers; contractors;
or operators of hotels, restaurants, or other similar establishments. The goods
sold must be merchandise for resale or supplies for use in the buyer™s business
operation. The work performed for the taxpayer must be the salesperson™s principal
business activity.
c.
Officers of exempt organizations are considered statutory employees.
d.
The employer withholds Social Security and Medicare taxes from the wages of statutory
employees if 
all three of the following
 conditions apply:
1)
The service contract states or implies that substantially all the services are to be
performed by them.
2)
They do not have a substantial investment in the equipment and property used to
perform the services (other than an investment in transportation facilities).
3)
The services are performed on a continuing basis for the same payer.
e.
Companies report their payments to statutory employees on Form W-2, but they must
check Box 13 on the W-2 for ﬁStatutory employee.ﬂ
1)
Federal income tax is not withheld from the wages of statutory employees.
2)
Federal unemployment (FUTA) taxes are paid by employers on the first and fourth
categories 
[b.1) and b.4) above]
 of statutory employees but not on categories 
b.2)
and b.3)
